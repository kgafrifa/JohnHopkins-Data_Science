Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, part of Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins University on Coursera. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 
called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the 
scripts work and how they are connected.
Analysis R Script

How The Repository Functions
- Download the entire repo
- Open the R Markdown file run_analysis.R
- Run all chunks of R code in run_analysis.R

Step-by-Step Analysis
- Downloading raw data
- Loading subject, features and activity data
- Combining/Merging the various loaded data
- Factoring activity levels
- Naming variables: subject, feature and activity
- Subsetting features data
- Combining to a final data frame
- Explicitly naming time and frequency variables
- Extracting mean and standard deviation
- Write the clean dataset to a text file
